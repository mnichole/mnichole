 👋Hi there 👋 I'm Muthoni Nichole ,a Mechatronics and front end enthusiast
 
  🚀About me
Karibu,I mean welcome to my GitHUB! I'm currently a mechatronics student with deep interest in robotics-especially humanoid robots,IoT systems,automation and machine learning.Besides tinkering with circuits and motors, I'm also excited diving into web development to build intuitive interfaces for my projects hence bridging the gap between robotics and web technologies .I enjoy turning ideas into life.

  🎯Learning and goals
I'm currently diving into sharpening my front end skills, so as to ;
1) Build a accessible and responsible interfaces
2) Learn best practices for maintainable code
3) Integrate APIs and data handling
4) Maximize performance and SEO with Next. js
5) Master styling and UI design
6) Enhance interactivity with JavaScript and React
   
The front end skills will be applied in ;
1) Real time monitoring and control
2) Human-machine interface
3) User Experience and efficiency
4) Remote access and IoT intergration
5) Data visualisation and analytics
    
  🔥THE END GOAL 
To create a smooth and interactive bridge between humans and mechatronic systems through modern tech, making automation and robotics more intuitive, efficient and remotely accessible
